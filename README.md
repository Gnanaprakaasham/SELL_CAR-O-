**WebApp:** https://sell-car-o.herokuapp.com/

**Description:**
Also took the years from which the car is bought and gives you the price of car you are seeking to sell to the buyer / individual.
Used ML  algorithms like Random Forest Regression and deployed it on Heroku.
In addition, the dataset is taken from existing car-dealer seller website in kaggle . 
Through this project, I had done data visualisation and jottted down the feature importance  and seen what drives the industry of selling and buying commercial websites.
